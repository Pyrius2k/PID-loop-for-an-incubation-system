# üå°Ô∏è PID Loop for an Incubation System

This repository contains the documentation and core files for a project focused on developing and implementing a **PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control loop** to maintain a stable temperature within a custom-built incubation system. The system is designed for a variety of applications, including biological experiments that require precise thermal control.
