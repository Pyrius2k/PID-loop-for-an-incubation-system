# üå°Ô∏è PID Loop for a Quantum-Sensing Incubation System

---

This repository contains the documentation and core files from a **master‚Äôs thesis project** in biomedical engineering. The main focus was the design and implementation of a robust **PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control loop** for a custom-built incubation system.

The system is intended for **long-term cultivation and observation of biological tissue samples**, with a special emphasis on integration into **wide-field microscopes** utilizing **nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond** for quantum sensing.

## ‚ú® Project Goal

The objective was to enable **stable temperature and atmospheric control** inside an incubator specifically designed for high-resolution microscopy experiments. Specifically:

-   Cultivate **precision-cut tissue slices (PCTS)** of the colon under physiological conditions ($37\ ^{\circ}\text{C}$, controlled gas mixture).
-   Maintain optimal environmental conditions for **biocompatibility and long-term cell vitality**.
-   Allow **NV-based quantum sensing microscopy** to run long-term experiments without sample degradation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology & System Components

The project involved the design and realization of a multi-component system, focusing on thermal, gas, and humidity control.

### Incubator Design and Thermal Control

The custom chamber was designed to fit precisely within the mechanical constraints of a wide-field microscope. Temperature stability was achieved using a heating wire wrapped around the core component, regulated by the custom Arduino-based PID loop.

## üìÑ Background & Related Work

This project builds upon advances in **NV-based quantum sensing** and **precision control in microscopy**.

**How NV centers detect magnetic fields (briefly):**
Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond act as **quantum sensors** because their electron spin states are sensitive to magnetic fields. By shining laser light and reading out their **spin-dependent fluorescence**, it is possible to detect extremely weak magnetic fields at the nanoscale, even under ambient conditions. This makes them ideal for biological imaging and long-term monitoring.
