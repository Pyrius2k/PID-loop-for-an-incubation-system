# üå°Ô∏è PID Loop for an Incubation System

---

This repository contains the documentation and core files from a **master‚Äôs thesis project** in applied physics and biomedical engineering. The main focus was the design and implementation of a **PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control loop** for a custom-built incubation system.  

The system is intended for **long-term cultivation and observation of biological tissue samples**, with a special emphasis on integration into **wide-field microscopes** utilizing **nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond** for quantum sensing.

## ‚ú® Project Goal

The objective was to enable **stable temperature control** inside an incubator designed for microscopy experiments. Specifically:  
- Cultivate **precision-cut tissue slices (PCTS)** of the colon under physiological conditions.  
- Maintain optimal environmental conditions for **biocompatibility and cell vitality**.  
- Allow **NV-based quantum sensing microscopy** to run long-term experiments without sample degradation.
